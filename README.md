A chrome extension that tracks Twitter Users’ NFT transactions and provides fundamental analysis.


What is Blocktracker

Twitter is the public town square of Web3 communities. Influencers publish bullish or bearish tweets about crypto assets. 
However, their followers do not know whether their words match their transactions due to the technical barrier of understanding records and smart contracts on Ethereum. Blocktracker, built by ex-Tiktok engineers, utilizes AI to extract data from blockchain and match wallet addresses with Twitter accounts. Users can see Web3 information from people they follow, such as the latest NFT transactions, lifetime yield rate, and more.
We believe what makes web3 work is its transparency and openness. Data should be easy to use and easy to understand. Everyone should have access of the data, rather than only geeks, experts or professional traders. It is just unfair. So we build blocktracker in order to enable every web3 user to have access to the data from blockchain.
